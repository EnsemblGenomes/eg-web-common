<h1>Genomic alignments</h1>

<p>NB: Some of the alignment statistics are only available via the Ensembl 75 archive (January 2014), but are still valid for the current version. Redirections are explicitly stated when used.</p>

<h2 id="blastz_net">BlastZ-net/Lastz-net Pairwise Alignment Analysis</h2>

<p>BlastZ-net (<a href="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/13/1/103">Schwartz
S et al., Genome Res.;13(1):103-7</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/20/11484">Kent
WJ et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A., 2003;100(20):11484-9</a>) or the newer version <a href="http://www.bx.psu.edu/~rsharris/lastz/">LastZ-net</a>
alignments are provided for closely related pairs of species. The
alignments are the results of post-processing the raw BlastZ or LastZ results.
In the first step, original blocks are chained according to their
location in both genomes. The netting process chooses for the reference
species the best sub-chain in each region. The reference species in the
BlastZ-net or LastZ-net alignments is in bold:</p>

<h2 id="tblat">Translated Blat Pairwise Alignment Analysis</h2>

<p>Translated blat (<a href="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656">Kent
W, Genome Res., 2002;12(4):656-64</a>) is used to look for
homologous regions between more distantly related pairs of species. We
expect to find homologies mainly in coding regions. There are 2 sets of
translated blat analyses: a new set where the raw results were passed through 
a chain and netting procedure similar to that used for the BlastZ-net analyses 
to produce the best sub-chain for the reference species (Translated Blat Net).</p>

<h2 id="pecan">PECAN Multiple Alignment Analysis</h2>


<p>Pecan is used to provide global multiple genomic alignments. First,
Mercator is used to build a synteny map between the genomes and then
Pecan builds alignments in these syntenic regions.</p>

<p>Pecan is a global multiple sequence alignment program that makes
practical the probabilistic consistency methodology for significant
numbers of sequences of practically arbitrary length. As input it
takes a set of sequences and a phylogenetic tree. The parameters and
heuristics it employs are highly user configurable, it is written
entirely in Java and also requires the installation of Exonerate.

<h2 id="epo">EPO Multiple Alignment Analysis</h2>


<p>The EPO 
(Enredo, Pecan, Ortheus) <a href="/info/genome/compara/epo_anchors_info.html" class="bold">pipeline</a> is a three step pipeline for whole-genome
multiple alignments. Enredo produces colinear segments from 
extant genomes handling both rearrangements, deletions and duplications. 
Pecan, as described above, is used to align these segments. Finally, Ortheus 
is used to create genome-wide ancestral sequence reconstructions.
Further details on these methods can be found at:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gr.076521.108">Genome-wide nucleotide-level mammalian ancestor reconstruction</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The high coverage eutherian mammal alignments were generated using the recent EPO (Enredo Pecan Ortheus) pipeline.  </p>

<p>Each alignment set can be accessed using the <a href="/info/docs/Doxygen/compara-api/index.html"> Compara API</a> via the Bio::EnsEMBL::DBSQL::MethodLinkSpeciesSetAdaptor using the method_link_type and either the list of the species or the species_set_name. </p>


[[SCRIPT::EnsEMBL::Web::Document::HTML::Compara::format_wga_list(EPO)]]

<p>The full set of eutherian mammmal alignments were not generated using the EPO pipeline due to difficulties with running Ortheus on the low coverage genomes. Instead the low coverage genomes were projected on to the high coverage EPO eutherian mammal alignments using (B)lastZ-net alignments. </p>

[[SCRIPT::EnsEMBL::Web::Document::HTML::Compara::format_wga_list(EPO_LOW_COVERAGE)]]


<p id="ancestral"><strong>Ancestral sequences</strong> are inferred from the EPO multiple alignments 
using Ortheus. Ortheus is a probabilistic method for the inference of ancestor, a.k.a tree, 
alignments. The main contribution of Ortheus is the use of a phylogenetic model incorporating 
gaps to infer insertion and deletion events. Ancestral sequences are predicted for each node 
of the phylogenetic tree that relates the sequences. Each ancestral sequence is named 
according to the derived extant species. For example, a sequence named Hsap, Ptro, Mmul 
corresponds to the ancestor of the <i>Homo sapiens</i>, <i>Pan troglodytes</i>, and 
<i>Macaca mulatta</i> genomes.  </p>

<h2 id="age_of_base">Age of Base</h2>

<p>From these ancestral sequences, we infer the <b>age of a base</b>, i.e. 
the timing of the most recent mutation for each base of the genome. Each position of the human genome
is compared to its immediate inferred ancestor, then its ancestor, etc. until a difference is found. 
The inferred substitution event therefore occurred on a specific branch of the tree, which is identified
by all the extant species which eventually descended from that branch, as illustrated below.</p>

<h2 id="conservation">Conservation Analysis</h2>

<p>Additionally we use Gerp
(<a href="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/15/7/901">Cooper
GM et al., Genome Res., 2005; 15:901-913</a>) to calculate conservation
scores and call constrained elements on the PECAN and EPO_LOW_COVERAGE multiple alignments.
Conservation scores are estimated on a column-by-column basis.
Constrained elements are stretches of the multiple alignment where the
sequences are highly conserved according to the previous score.</p>



<h2 id="synteny">Synteny Analysis</h2>

<p>We calculate syntenic regions using blastz-net alignments. We look for
stretches where the alignment blocks are in synteny. The search is run in
two phases. In the first one, syntenic alignments that are closer than 200
kbp are grouped. In the second phase, the groups that are in synteny are
linked provided that no more than 2 non-syntenic groups are found between
them and they are less than 3Mbp apart.</p>
