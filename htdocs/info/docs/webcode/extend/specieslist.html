<h1>Customising the species list on your home page</h1>

<p>If you are installing a subset of the standard Ensembl or Ensembl Genomes species, you can leave the plugins as-is
and your home page will be generated automatically.</p>

<p>If, however, you are adding species from taxa not found in Ensembl you will need to create the appropriate files in your site plugin.</p>

<p>For a site with few species, it is usually sufficient to provide a list of static links, or
a simple list can be auto-generated using the information stored in SpeciesDefs. See
<code>EnsEMBL::Web::Document::HTML::SpeciesList</code> for sample code.</p>

<h2>Organising your species</h2>

<p>If your site has a lot of species, you may wish to group these in a similar way to Ensembl.
To do this, you need taxonomy data in the 'meta' table of your core database. The standard format 
is for the taxa to be listed in ascending order when ordered by meta_id, e.g.</p>
<pre>
mysql&gt; select * from meta where meta_key = 'species.classification' order by meta_id;
+---------+------------------------+------------------+
| meta_id | meta_key               | meta_value       |
+---------+------------------------+------------------+
|    1039 | species.classification | sapiens          |
|    1040 | species.classification | Homo             |
|    1041 | species.classification | Hominidae        |
|    1042 | species.classification | Catarrhini       |
|    1043 | species.classification | Haplorrhini      |
|    1044 | species.classification | Primates         |
|    1045 | species.classification | Euarchontoglires |
|    1046 | species.classification | Eutheria         |
|    1047 | species.classification | Mammalia         |
|    1048 | species.classification | Euteleostomi     |
|    1049 | species.classification | Vertebrata       |
|    1050 | species.classification | Craniata         |
|    1051 | species.classification | Chordata         |
|    1052 | species.classification | Metazoa          |
|    1053 | species.classification | Eukaryota        |
+---------+------------------------+------------------+
</pre>

<p>When provided with a list of taxa, SpeciesDefs will compare the two in order to classify
your species into groups.</p>

<p>The next step is therefore to identify the taxa that correspond to the groups you want.
Ideally you want about 2-7 species in each group (the normal range for human short-term
memory to handle). In Ensembl, we have many different mammal species, some other vertebrates, 
and a few non-vertebrates. We have thus divided our species as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primates</li>
<li>Other Euarchontoglires (rodents and so forth)</li>
<li>Laurasiatheria</li>
<li>Afrotheria</li>
<li>Xenarthra</li>
<li>Marsupials and Monotremes</li>
<li>Birds and Reptiles</li>
<li>Amphibians</li>
<li>Fish</li>
<li>Other chordates*</li>
<li>Other eukaryotes</li>
</ul>

<p class="footnotes">* Although this is a very broad set of phyla, they have few representative 
genomes, having been sequenced primarily for comparative purposes, so we list them together.</p>

<p>Once you have decided how to group your species, you need to sketch a taxonomic tree that 
includes the identifying nodes. In the diagram below, the highlighted taxa are the ones that 
will be needed to separate species into the required groups.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/img/info/taxonomy.png" alt="tree diagram" style="width:353px;height:500px" /></p>

<p>Finally you will need to set up your [plugin]/conf/ini-files/DEFAULTS.ini to contain 
the groups you wish to select and the corresponding labels. The order of the groups
must follow your taxonomic tree from bottom to top:</p>

<pre class="code">
TAXON_ORDER = [Primates Euarchontoglires Laurasiatheria Afrotheria Xenarthra Metatheria 
Monotremata Sauropsida Amphibia Euteleostomi Chordata Eukaryota]</pre>

<p>If you want any of these taxa to be grouped together, or to use labels other than their
scientific name, you also need a hash of labels:

<pre class="code">
[TAXON_LABEL]

Euarchontoglires   = Rodents etc.
Metatheria         = Marsupials &amp; Monotremes
Monotremata        = Marsupials &amp; Monotremes
Sauropsida         = Birds &amp; Reptiles
Amphibia           = Amphibians
Euteleostomi       = Fish
Chordata           = Other chordates
Eukaryota          = Other eukaryotes
</pre>

<p>Note that by setting the same group label for different taxa, we can combine taxonomic groups
that are in different branches of the taxonomic tree</p>

<h4>Caveats</h4>

<p>A few things that could potentially cause problems are:</p>

<ol class="spaced">
<li>Each species ini file must contain the block:
<p><kbd>[TAXON_LABEL]
<br /># Accept defaults</kbd></p>
</li>
<li>If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Ensembl, please check that each species ini
file has the parameter <kbd>ENSEMBL_GROUP</kbd> deleted, as it is now generated automatically.</li>
<li>If you are upgrading from Ensembl 48 to 49, the taxon parameters in DEFAULTS.ini have changed
slightly to take into account Perl's inability to keep the order of elements in a hash.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Multi species databases in Ensembl Genomes</h2>
Note, that while Ensembl Genomes data is generally organised in a similar fashion to Ensembl data, in the case of bacteria, the Ensembl API and schema have been extended to support the use of multi-species databases.  Specifically, this means that in two tables: <b>meta</b> and <b>coord_system</b>, a new field, <b>species_id</b>, has been added, allowing the assignment of DNA molecules, and attributes, to individual species (and thereby allowing the storing of distinct data from multiple species within the same DB).  Information about how to do this using the Ensembl API is provided <a href="/info/docs/api/registry.html">here</a>. The API is largely transparent, and will handle single-species databases without any need to explictly refer to species IDs (IDs of 1 are assigned by default).
