<h1>Export via website</h1>

<p>Many of the pages displaying Ensembl genomic data offer an export
option, suitable for small amounts of data.</p>

<p>This is the ideal option if you want a short sequence as a FASTA file, or a GFF file
of a few features in a region. Simply find your desired feature or region, click on one of
the "Export..." links in the left-hand menu, and select your output options.</p> 

<p>We respectfully request that you do not script against the export pages on the Ensembl 
website, as this degrades the service for other web visitors. The <a href="mysql.html">public MySQL server</a> 
is provided specifically for this purpose. Thank you.</p>

<p>If you wish to extract multiple features or regions, we recommend using the
<a href="/info/data/api.html">Perl API</a> if possible.</p>
