<h1>Pan-taxonomic compara</h1>

<p>The pan-taxonomic compara is built using representative genomes from all significant 
clades represented in <a href="https://www.ensembl.org/">Ensembl</a> and
<a href="https://www.ensemblgenomes.org/">Ensembl Genomes</a>, to offer a broad view of homologous
relationships from across the taxonomy. This analysis enables the production of protein trees 
and orthologies across all the taxonomic groups in Ensembl and Ensembl Genomes.

<h2>Species in the pan-taxonomic compara</h2>

<p>Model genomes along with genomes not represented by the familes of model organisms are picked for this analysis.</p>

<p>The bacterial genomes included are selected on the following criteria:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Presence in earlier versions of the pan-taxonomic compara</li>
  <li>Presence in the UniProtKB <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes?facets=proteome_type%3A1&query=%2A">reference proteome list</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://europepmc.org/">Europe PubMed Central</a> citation count of over 1000</li>
</ol>

<h2>Data Access </h2>

<p>The gene trees obtained from this analysis can be accessed in the genome browser and also using the <a href="/info/data/api.html">Perl API</a> 
and <a href="https://rest.ensembl.org">REST API</a>. Note that when using the APIs,
the pan-taxonomic comparative genomics data resource can be picked using the name "pan_homology".</p>
