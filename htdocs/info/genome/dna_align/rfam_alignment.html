<h1>Rfam covariance model alignment</h1>

<p>Covariance models from <a href="http://rfam.xfam.org">Rfam</a> are aligned to genomes in 
<a href="http://plants.ensembl.org">Ensembl Plants</a> and 
<a href="http://metazoa.ensembl.org">Ensembl Metazoa</a>. The covariance models are taxonomically 
filtered before alignment, so that structural RNA features that have never been annotated in plant 
species are not inappropriately aligned. The alignment is performed with <i>cmscan</i>, from the 
<a href="http://eddylab.org/infernal">Infernal</a> software suite.</p>

<p>The Rfam alignments are visible as a browser track (named 'Rfam models'); selecting an alignment 
in the genome browser displays metadata such as the Rfam description and the secondary structure.</p>

<p>These alignments form the basis of the main component of <a href="/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html">RNA gene annotation</a> in Ensembl Genomes.</p>
