  <h1>Building an Ensembl Genomes Mirror</h1>

<p>
The build instructions are split into three sections:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to install other applications required by Ensembl: CVS, Perl, MySQL, Apache 2, Dotter</li>
  <li>How to install the Ensembl and BioMart software</li>
  <li>How to install the Ensembl data</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ensembl and MySQL</h2>
<p>
  PLEASE NOTE - even if you do not wish to download all the Ensembl data - for the website to function
  you will need:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a local database server to manage display settings and user accounts (if these are enabled).</li>
  <li>the mysql client software installed on your machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you do not wish to run MySQL (or cannot run a MySQL server locally) <strong>AND</strong> you do not
  wish to enable user accounts then you can alternatively install SQLite as an alternative server.
</p>

<h2>Ensembl Genomes Version Numbers...</h2>
<p>
  Each Ensembl Genomes release has two integer version numbers associated with it, and these version numbers are
  used to identify the correct versions of API, Web code and databases (see below) that make up that
  release.
</p>
<p>
  For the API and Web code, a CVS branch (essentially a named snapshot of the code) is made for each Ensembl
  release, named with the release version number. The current release is version [[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]],
  and the CVS tag for identifying the API and Web code for this release is 'branch-ensembl-[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]'.
</p>
<p>
  For the extra Ensembl Genomes modules, a CVS branch (essentially a named snapshot of the code) is made for each Ensembl Genomes
  release, named with the Ensembl and Ensembl Genomes release version numbers. The current release is version [[SPECIESDEFS::SITE_RELEASE_VERSION]] - [[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]],
  and the CVS tag for identifying the API and Web code for this release is 'branch-ensemblgenomes-[[SPECIESDEFS::SITE_RELEASE_VERSION]]-[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]'.
</p>

<p>
  The Ensembl Genomes database names consist of the species, the database type, the ensembl release number, the ensembl genomes release number and the
  data version. The current bacillus 'core' database is named bacillus_core_[[SPECIESDEFS::SITE_RELEASE_VERSION]]_[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]_[[SPECIESINFO::Bacillus:SPECIES_RELEASE_VERSION]]. i.e. a
  bacillus core database, release [[SPECIESDEFS::SITE_RELEASE_VERSION]], Ensembl release [[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]] data version [[SPECIESINFO::Bacillus:SPECIES_RELEASE_VERSION]] built on the EB2 assembly. Subsequent data
  releases on the same assembly are suffixed with a lower case letter (a, b, etc.).
</p>

<p>
  The idea is that components with the same release version should work together - i.e. any web site built
  with 'version 51' API and web code, and 'version 51' databases should work correctly.

<p>Once you have completed all these steps, you are ready to configure your installation.
