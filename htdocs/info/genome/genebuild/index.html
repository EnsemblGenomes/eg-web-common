<h1>Gene annotation in Ensembl Genomes</h1>

<h2>Main genebuild</h2>

<p>
Data in Ensembl Genomes comes from a variety of sources; in some cases, genes are built by collaborators; in some cases, we are actively involved ourselves in an <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/genebuild/index.html">Ensembl-style genebuild process</a>; in other cases, databases are built from assembling information already available in the public archives
</p>
<p>See the homepage for each species or collection for more information about how genes in this data set have been built.
</p>.

<h2>More genes</h2>

<p>Ensembl Genomes also includes automatically-annotated <a href="ncrna.html">non-coding RNAs</a>.</p>
