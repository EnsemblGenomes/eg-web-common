<h1>The Ensembl Genomes Release cycle</h1>

<p>Ensembl Genomes data will be released on an approximately two-month release cycle.  Where possible, we will attempt to ensure that database schemas are maintained on the same version of the Ensembl schema as the Ensembl itself; for example, the first releases of the databases found in Ensembl Bacteria, Ensembl Protists and Ensembl Metazoa are numbered 1_52, indicating that data release 1 of Ensembl Bacteria utilises the schema design developed for Ensembl release 52.</p>
<p>
Whenever possible, we will synchronise Ensembl Genomes data releases with Ensembl releases (and to synchronise releases of each of the five Ensembl Genomes suites: <A HREF="http://www.metazoa.ensembl.org">Ensembl Metazoa</A>, <A HREF="http://www.plants.ensembl.org">Ensembl Plants</A>, <A HREF="http://www.fungi.ensembl.org">Ensembl Fungi</A>, <A HREF="http://www.protits.ensembl.org">Ensembl Protists</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.metazoa.ensembl.org">Ensembl Bacteria</A> with each other. When this is not possible, we will endeavour to ensure that the latest Ensembl Genomes data is always available in the same schema version as the latest Ensembl release, to enable access to all Ensembl and Ensembl Genomes databases through the same version of the Ensembl API. We will patch our databases upon any update to the Ensembl schema if not accompanied by a corresponding data release of our own.  Thus, the second version of Ensembl Genomes databases to be released is likely to be numbered 1_53, implying the same data will be contained in these databases as in the initial version, but that a migration to the subsequent Ensembl schema has taken place (coincident with Ensembl release 53).</p>
<p>
The process for building a release of Ensembl Genomes is potentially more varied than for the construction of an Ensembl release.  With many genomes, we take data from collaborators in the wider scientific community; with others, we build Ensembl databases from submissions to the public repositories; with others, we are engaged in classical Ensembl-style gene builds (see (A HREF="http://www.ensembl.org/info/about/release_cycle.html">this page</A> for more information about the Ensembl release cycle). The basic structure of a release cycle remains the same in all cases, consisting of the production or import of a core database, the performance of analyses (e.g. comparative genomics) upon that data, the construction of a query-optimised data warehouse, or Mart, the configuration of the website and the publication of the new release.
