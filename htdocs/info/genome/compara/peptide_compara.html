<h1>Peptide comparative genomics</h1>

<p>Each Ensembl Genomes division, apart from Ensembl Bacteria, performs comparative analyses 
at the peptide level, and an additional <a href="/info/genome/compara/pan_compara.html">pan-taxonomic comparative analysis</a> is performed for a set of representative species from across the 
taxonomic space. In brief, the <a href="/info/genome/compara/homology_method.html">methodology</a> uses 
peptide sequence alignments to cluster proteins, which are then aligned, and phylogenetic trees 
are inferred from those alignments. Finally, lists of orthologues and paralogues are derived from 
the gene trees.</p>

<p>For Ensembl Protists and Ensembl Fungi, one genome per species is included in the peptide 
comparative analysis. The selection of this genome is based on prior inclusion in Ensembl Genomes, 
or the date of its submission to INSDC. For Ensembl Bacteria, 123 important genomes are included 
in the <a href="/info/genome/compara/pan_compara.html">pan-taxonomic comparative analysis</a>; 
these are selected to provide one representative genome from any species which either features 
in the curated <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/?query=*&amp;fil=reference%3Ayes">reference proteome set</a> from <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/">UniProt</a>, or which has a high citation 
rate in <a href="http://europepmc.org/">Europe PubMed Central</a>.</p>

<!--<p>We provide lists of the genomes in <a href="/info/genomes?field_peptide_alignments_value=1">division-specific</a> and <a href="/info/genomes?pan_compara=1">pan-taxonomic</a> peptide comparative analyses.</p>-->

<h2>Orthologue QC</h2>

<p>A subset of orthologues are classified as a "high confidence" set. At a minimum, orthologous 
proteins must have percentage identity above a certain threshold, currently set at 25% for all 
species, and satisfy a <a href="/info/genome/compara/homology_method.html#homology_types">"tree-compliance" metric</a> that identifies orthologues inferred from dubious tree topologies.</p>

<p>For some species in Ensembl Metazoa, orthologue metrics have been calculated using two 
orthogonal sources of information: gene order conservation (GOC) and whole genome alignments (WGA). 
The <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/compara/Ortholog_qc_manual.html">methodology is described in more detail elsewhere</a>, but briefly: The "GOC score" metric for a pair of orthologues 
measures whether the two genes up- and downstream of each gene in the orthologue pair are also 
orthologous, and allows for inversions and gene insertions. The "WGA coverage" metric determines 
the extent to which the orthologous regions have been aligned by pairwise genome alignments, 
primarily based on exonic coverage, with a small contribution from intronic coverage. Both metrics 
have a value between 0 and 100.</p>

<p>There is only an expectation for gene order conservation between species that are evolutionarily 
close; thus the GOC score is only calculated within Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Nematoda. Similarly, 
pairwise WGAs, and thus the related metric, are only available for a subset of fairly 
closely-related species. To classify orthologues as "high confidence", thresholds are applied to 
the orthologue metrics, according to the evolutionary distance between the species. Within 
Aculeata, Caenorhabditis, Drosophila, and Onchocercidae the GOC threshold is 50 and the 
WGA threshold is 50; no thresholds are applied beyond these clades.</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>

<p>Interactive gene trees and homologue data can be accessed in the <a href="/info/website/tutorials/compara.html">genome browser</a>, and also with the <a href="/info/data/api.html">Perl API</a> and 
<a href="http://rest.ensembl.org">REST</a> service. Data files are also made available via the 
Ensembl Genomes <a href="/info/data/ftp/">FTP site</a>.</p>
