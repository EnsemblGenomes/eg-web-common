<h1>Gene families</h1>

<p>Gene families are sets of proteins that have been clustered based on sequence similarity. 
In Ensembl Genomes, these are used to provide a way of exploring similar proteins across a 
wide range of bacterial genomes for which the standard peptide comparative pipeline cannot be run. 
Gene families are displayed in the <a
  href="https://bacteria.ensembl.org/Escherichia_coli_str_k_12_substr_mg1655_gca_000005845/Gene/Gene_families?g=b0344;r=Chromosome:362455-365529;t=AAC73447">
  web interface</a>
or can be accessed using the <a href="/info/docs/api/compara/compara_tutorial.html">Ensembl Compara Perl API</a>.</p>

<p>In Ensembl Bacteria, Fungi and Protists, gene families are populated with proteins on all genomes by using
the <a href="https://hamap.expasy.org/">HAMAP</a> and <a href="https://www.pantherdb.org/">PANTHER</a>
classification provided by <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro">InterPro</a>. This InterPro gene families
pipeline uses the same database schema and API as the <a href="https://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/compara/family.html">
Ensembl Vertebrates gene family pipeline</a>, but the families generated by these two pipelines are generated
using different methods, and should not be interpreted as equivalent.</p>

<p>InterPro gene families are not available for other Ensembl Genomes divisions
such as Plants or Metazoa. However, in exceptional circumstances, if a protein
cluster identified by the <a href="/info/genome/compara/homology_method.html">
gene-tree building process</a> is too large to process completely within the
constraints of the release cycle, it may be made available via the gene
families web view.</p>
