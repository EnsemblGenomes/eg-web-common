<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>We provide a number of ready-made tools for processing your data. At the moment, small datasets can be uploaded to our servers and processed online; for larger datasets, we provide an API script that can be downloaded (you will also need to <a href="/info/genome/api/">install our Perl API</a> to use these).</p>
<p>In the near future we aim to offer an intermediate service, whereby medium-to-large data sets can be submitted to a queue, similar to BLAST.</p>
<p>Currently available:</p>
