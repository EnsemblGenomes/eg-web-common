<h1>Changing the appearance of your Ensembl website</h1>

<p>
The Ensembl code is used to run many different sites hosted at the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, including <a href="http://www.ensembl.org">www.ensembl.org</a>, <a href="http://www.ensemblgenomes.org>www.ensemblgenomes.org</A>, <a href="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk">vega.sanger.ac.uk</a>, Ensembl archive and pre! sites, and private sites used for internal development.
In order to distinguish these sites we use plugins to alter the colour scheme
and/or site logo, in addition to the changes in content. For example, the Vega site 
is blue, pre! is turquoise, and the archives are lilac.
</p>

<p>
You may find it useful to do something similar with an Ensembl mirror,
so that your users know they are looking at a local copy and not the actual
Ensembl site.
</p>

<p>In the examples below, we'll assume that you are adding these changes
to the normal <code>/public-plugins/mirror</code> directory.</p>

<p><strong>Important note</strong>: if you make any changes to .ini files,
you need to remove <code>/conf/config.packed</code> before restarting the
server, to ensure your changes are recompiled.</p> 

<h2>Changing the site logo</h2>

<p>The Ensembl logo graphic can be found in <code>/htdocs/i/</code> directory.
First you should make a directory</p>

<p><code>/public-plugins/mirror/htdocs/i/</code></p>

<p>and copy your logo into it. Ideally your logo should be around 
40 pixels high, so that it does not break the template layout.</p> 

<p>You will then need to add the following lines to 
your <code>/public-plugins/mirror/conf/ini-files/DEFAULTS.ini</code> file,
substituting the appropriate parameters:</p>

<pre class="code">
[ENSEMBL_STYLE]
SITE_LOGO        = e-ensembl.gif
SITE_LOGO_ALT    = Ensembl Home
SITE_LOGO_WIDTH  = 150
SITE_LOGO_HEIGHT = 40
SITE_LOGO_HREF   = /
</pre>

<p>The <code>SITE_LOGO_HREF</code> parameter is only needed if your Ensembl mirror does not occupy the root
of the host domain - omit this line to use the default link "/"</p>

<h2>Changing the colour scheme</h2>

<p>The colour scheme can be altered by adding the following to
<code>/public-plugins/mirror/conf/ini-files/DEFAULTS.ini</code>
(you can omit the [ENSEMBL_STYLE] header if you already have
a custom logo defined, as above):

<pre class="code">
[ENSEMBL_STYLE]
# Main template colours

# General
PAGE_BG         = ffffff
PAGE_TEXT       = 555555
PAGE_HEADER     = 666666
PAGE_LINK       = 3366bb
PAGE_VISITED    = 000066
PAGE_HOVER      = cc0000

# Masthead
MH_BG           = 333366
MH_BORDER       = 336699
MH_TEXT         = ccddff
MH_LINK         = ffffff
MH_VISITED      = ffffff
MH_HOVER        = cc0000

# Extras
TINT_BG         = eaeeff ; used as 'tint' colour on spreadsheets [1]
TINT_BORDER     = bbccff
CONTRAST_TEXT   = 333333
CONTRAST_BG     = ffffdd ; used as 'tint' colour on spreadsheets [1]
CONTRAST_BORDER = ffee99 ; [2]
CONTRAST_HEADER = 993333

# These probably won't need customising on your site unless your
# colour scheme is very strange!

PANEL_BG        = ffffff ; normally same as PAGE_BG [1]
PANEL_BORDER    = cccccc ; [2]
PANEL_TEXT      = 555555 ; normally same as PAGE_TEXT

NEUTRAL_BG      = f0f0f0 ; used for spreadsheet table stripes [1]
NEUTRAL_BORDER  = cccccc ; [2]

REVERSE_TEXT    = ffffff ; normally white

ALERT_BG        = ffcccc ; [1]
ALERT_BORDER    = 993333 ; [2]
ALERT_TEXT      = 333333

# [1] needs to be pale enough for links to show
# [2] needs to be dark enough for REVERSE_TEXT to show

# Styles for auto-generated images

IMAGE_BG1       = ffffe7 ; default background color for image
IMAGE_BG2       = ffffcc ; color for alternating stripes..

HIGHLIGHT1      = e8ffcc ; Highlight colour (pale)
HIGHLIGHT2      = ccff99 ; Highlight colour (vivid)

CONTIGBLUE1     = 368ec9 ; Contig-colours (light)
CONTIGBLUE2     = 02599c ; Contig-colours (dark)

</pre>

<p>Simply alter the hex values to the colours you want. These placeholder 
values will be compiled into the Ensembl css files on server startup.</p>

<p>Note: we recommend not changing the font sizes, or you may have problems with your graphics!</p>
