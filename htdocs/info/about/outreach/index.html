<h1>Outreach</h1>

<p>
The Outreach team is the main contact point for EnsemblGenomes users. We respond to
queries by <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ensemblgenomes.org">email</a>, ensure that problems identified are resolved by liaising with the Ensembl Genomes team, and we give workshops, demos and presentations on the use of Ensembl Genomes worldwide. An example of a typical browser workshop is given below.
</p>

<h2>Browser workshop</h2>
<p>Our standard 1-day browser workshop offers participants the possibility of gaining considerable hands-on experience in the use of the Ensembl Genomes browser coupled with the necessary background information. The workshop is primarily targeted at wet lab researchers and individuals with an interest in bioinformatics.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The workshop consists of a series of modules, listed below. Most modules consist of a presentation, followed by interactive examples and exercises. Module content 
can be tailored to the research interest of the participants, just state the main species of interest.</p>

<p>A typical one-day workshop will consist of the first three modules, plus two other modules of your choice:</p>

<ul>
<li> Introduction to Ensembl Genomes: How the project extends Ensembl across the taxonomic space</li>

<li>Worked example: Guided tour demonstrating the main features of the Ensembl Genomes browser</li>

<li>Data mining with BioMart: Retrieving datasets using the data mining tool BioMart</li>

<li>Comparative genomics: Homologies, genome alignments, syntenic regions and phylogenetic trees</li>

<li>Variation: SNPs and indels</li>

<li>Building genomes (Ensembl Bacteria and Protists only): Understanding how gene models are generated</li>

</ul>
<p>Participants are encouraged to bring problems/questions about their research and we will try to tackle these during the workshop using Ensembl Genomes.

The only prerequisite for the browser workshop is general knowledge of molecular biology / genomics and a familiarity with web browsers. </p>



<p>
In addition the Outreach team regularly organises workshops on the use
of the Ensembl  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These
workshops normally are 2 or 3 days. If you  are interested in hosting
a workshop or want more information, please contact 
<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk?subject=Ensembl Genomes Workshop">Xos&eacute;&nbsp;Fern&aacute;ndez</a>.

</p>

<p>
For academic institutions our courses are free of charge. However we
request that travel, accommodation  and subsistence costs of the
instructor(s) are reimbursed by the host.
</p>

<h2>Working with Developers</h2>

<p>
Whilst our browser and API workshops are ideal for researchers who
make occasional use of our data,  we can also provide help for users
who wish to set up their own Ensembl/EnsemblGenomes installation, customise  an
Ensembl-based site and develop their own display pages.
</p>

<p>
A <a href="ashg_2009.html">developer workshop</a> is held approximately
once a year, and of course  there is
our <a href="/info/about/contact/mailing.html">developers' mailing
list</a> where you can  post questions to the whole Ensembl team.
</p>

<p>
For a more immersive experience, the
"<a href="/info/about/outreach/geek4aweek.html">Geek for a Week</a>"
scheme allows developers and researchers to work alongside Ensembl
team members for a short intensive collaborative project.
</p>


<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Computer room with a PC (or Mac) for each participant - 30 is the maximum number of participants</li>
<li>Each computer should have a (reasonably fast) internet connection and an internet browser installed (preferably FireFox, although Internet Explorer will also work)
</li>
<li>A computer for the instructor, connected to a projector, with an internet connection and MS PowerPoint installed</li>
</ul>



<h2>Certificates</h2>
<p>We don't usually make and give out certificates of attendance to participants; however if the host wishes to do this, this is fine by us and we will be happy to sign them!</p>
