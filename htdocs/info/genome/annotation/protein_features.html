<h1>Protein feature annotation</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ebi-pf-team/interproscan/wiki">InterProScan 5</a> pipeline [1] 
is used to annotate the translations of gene models for each genome. The pipeline scans sequences 
against <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro">InterPro</a> [2] signatures to identify protein 
families and domains. InterPro signatures are predictive models, provided by the different databases 
that make up the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/about.html#about_08">InterPro consortium</a>.
In addition, coiled coils, signal peptides, transmembrane domains, and low complexity regions are 
annotated with <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/2031185">ncoils</a>, 
<a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21959131">SignalP</a>, 
<a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/11152613">TMHMM</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.biology.wustl.edu/gcg/seg.html">seg</a>, respectively.</p>

<p>The InterPro families and domains are often associated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 
pathways, and this information is loaded when protein features are annotated. For example, the 
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/IPR013483">IPR013483</a> family is linked, 
by InterPro, to two GO terms and a KEGG pathway reference; consequently, these will be added as 
cross-references to any translation that is annotated with the IPR013483 family.</p>

<p>In the genome browser, protein features are displayed on the 'Splice variants' page 
(when viewing a gene) and on the 'Protein summary' and 'Domains &amp; features' pages 
(when viewing a transcript).</p>
