<h1>Synteny</h1>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synteny">Synteny</a> is the
  conserved order of aligned genomic blocks between species. It is
  calculated from <a href="/info/genome/compara/compara_analyses.html">
  pairwise genome alignments</a>, when both species have a
  chromosome-level assembly.
</p>

<p>This is done in two phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We search for alignment blocks that are in the same order in the two genomes.
    Syntenic alignments that are closer than 200 kb are grouped into a synteny block.
  </li>
  <li>Groups that are in synteny are linked, provided that no more than two non-syntenic
    groups are found between them and they are less than 3 Mb apart.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To avoid overly sparse syntenic views, a synteny dataset may be excluded
  if it has average genomic coverage below a threshold, typically 5%.
</p>

<p>For some synteny datasets, analysis parameters may have been tuned to account for differences
  in the underlying data such as genome size and evolutionary distance.
</p>

<p>Information on any current synteny data is listed alongside
  <a href="/info/genome/compara/compara_analyses.html">available alignments</a>.
