<h1>Gene families</h1>

<p>Gene families are sets of proteins that have been clustered based on sequence similarity. 
In Ensembl Genomes, these are used to provide a way of exploring similar proteins across a 
wide range of bacterial genomes for which the standard peptide comparative pipeline cannot be run. 
Gene families are displayed in the <a href="http://bacteria.ensembl.org/escherichia_coli_str_k_12_substr_mg1655/Gene/Gene_families?g=b0344;r=Chromosome:362455-365529;t=AAC73447">web interface</a> 
or can be accessed using the <a href="/info/docs/api/compara/compara_tutorial.html">Ensembl Compara Perl API</a>.</p>

<p>In Ensembl Bacteria, gene families are populated with proteins on all bacterial genomes by using 
the <a href="http://hamap.expasy.org/">HAMAP</a> and <a href="http://www.pantherdb.org/">PANTHER</a> 
classification provided by <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro">InterPro</a>. Note that while 
this uses the same database schema and API as Ensembl, it does not use the same 
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/compara/family.html">gene family pipeline</a>. 
Gene families are also not available for any other Ensembl Genomes division.</p>
