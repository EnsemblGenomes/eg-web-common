<h1>Identifier policy</h1>

<p>Most genomes provided by Ensembl Genomes contain primary gene annotation that has been 
imported from external sources. This includes the re-use of 
<a href="/info/docs/api/core/core_tutorial.html#genes">gene and other feature identifiers</a> 
assigned by those responsible for this annotation. Suitable identifiers are imported and attached 
as stable identifiers to the corresponding Ensembl feature. In contrast to Ensembl Vertebrates, 
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/stable_ids/index.html">stable identifiers</a> are 
<em>not</em> generated, and <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/stable_ids/versions.html">mapping</a> 
of identifiers between different versions of external gene models is not generally provided by 
Ensembl Genomes.</p>
<p>Note that in some cases, where specific unique identifiers are not provided, they may be 
generated from appropriate parent identifiers. For instance, unique transcript identifiers 
may be generated by appending a number to the end of an existing gene identifier. </p>
<p><a href="/info/data/insdc_annotation">More information</a> is provided on the procedure used 
for assigning identifiers for annotation imported from INSDC.</p>
