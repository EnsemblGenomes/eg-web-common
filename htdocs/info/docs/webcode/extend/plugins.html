<h1>More About Plugins</h1>

<p>Plugins are used to complement the normal system of inheritance in 
object-oriented Perl. Whereas a child object can inherit methods
from multiple parents, a parent object normally cannot be overridden by
multiple children. The plugin system "aggregates" the contents
of several methods into one "master" method that can then be used by
mod_perl when rendering the webpage.</p>

<p>The module <code>conf/Plugins.pm</code> controls which plugins are
used by an instance of Ensembl and their order of precedence. In a 
standard Ensembl mirror, the module will define a plugin array as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
$SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_PLUGINS = [
  'EnsEMBL::Mirror'    =&gt; $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT.'/public-plugins/mirror',
  'EnsEMBL::Ensembl'   =&gt; $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT.'/public-plugins/ensembl'
];
</pre>

<p>The plugins are processed in reverse order, starting with the last one:</p>

<dl>
<dt>/public-plugins/ensembl</dt>
<dd>This is the plugin used by www.ensembl.org to add all Ensembl species
and site-specific content to the base code</dd>
<dt>/public-plugins/mirror</dt>
<dd>This plugin over-rides /public-plugins/ensembl - normally it is used only 
to configure local server settings</dd>
</dl>
