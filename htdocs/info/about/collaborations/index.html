<h1>Collaborations</h1>

<p>Ensembl Genomes is funded by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and 
by grants from a variety of different funding sources. In addition to direct funding, 
we benefit from long term collaborations with a number of consortia developing 
genome annotation resources in particular areas.</p>

<p>We are also active participants in a number of specific genome annotation projects, 
and are open to new collaborations in many forms, from seeking joint funding to establish 
a new domain-focused resource, to an informal collaboration to annotate a particular genome 
(or to develop an alternative genome-wide data set) and prepare it for inclusion in [[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_SITENAME]]. 
The <a href="/info/about/outreach/geek4aweek.html">Geek for a Week</a> scheme allows 
developers and researchers to come to EBI and work alongside Ensembl team members for a 
short collaborative project.</p>

<p>Please <a href="/Help/Contact">contact us</a> to discuss any form of collaboration. 
Specific funded projects we have been involved with are listed in the lefthand menu. 
For an overview of [[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_SITENAME]] external funders, past and present, 
please see the <a href="/info/about/credits.html">acknowledgements</a> page. Additional
funders for other Ensembl Genomes divisions can be found on the corresponding websites</p>
