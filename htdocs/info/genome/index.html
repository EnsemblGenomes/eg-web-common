<h1>Annotation &amp; Prediction</h1>

<p>
The Ensembl Genomes Project provides annotation on genes and gene function that are 
obtained via import of external data or use of predictive algorithms. This data is available
across a range of taxa, including bacteria, fungi, plants, metazoa and other non-vertebrates.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/info/about/species.html">List of current [[SPECIESDEFS::SITE_NAME]] species</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In the near future, additional assemblies will be made available via our new site,
<a href="http://rapid.ensembl.org">rapid.ensembl.org</a>, which hosts a wide range of
species from large-scale sequencing projects such as 
<a href="https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/">Darwin Tree of Life</a>.</p> 

<p>In addition, a substantial number of vertebrate genomes are available
on the original Ensembl website, <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/">www.ensembl.org</a>.</p>
