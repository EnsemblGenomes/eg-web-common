<h1>Genomic alignments</h1>


<h2 id="blastz_net">BlastZ-net/Lastz-net Pairwise Alignment Analysis</h2>

<p>BlastZ-net (<a href="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/13/1/103">Schwartz
S et al., Genome Res.;13(1):103-7</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/20/11484">Kent
WJ et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A., 2003;100(20):11484-9</a>) or the newer version <a href="http://www.bx.psu.edu/~rsharris/lastz/">LastZ-net</a>
alignments are provided for closely related pairs of species. The
alignments are the results of post-processing the raw BlastZ or LastZ results.
In the first step, original blocks are chained according to their
location in both genomes. The netting process chooses for the reference
species the best sub-chain in each region. The reference species in the
BlastZ-net or LastZ-net alignments is in bold:</p>


<h2 id="tblat">Translated Blat Pairwise Alignment Analysis</h2>

<p>Translated blat (<a href="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656">Kent
W, Genome Res., 2002;12(4):656-64</a>) is used to look for
homologous regions between more distantly related pairs of species. We
expect to find homologies mainly in coding regions. There are 2 sets of
translated blat analyses: a new set where the raw results were passed through 
a chain and netting procedure similar to that used for the BlastZ-net analyses 
to produce the best sub-chain for the reference species (Translated Blat Net).</p>




<h2 id="synteny">Synteny Analysis</h2>

<p>We calculate syntenic regions using blastz-net alignments. We look for
stretches where the alignment blocks are in synteny. The search is run in
two phases. In the first one, syntenic alignments that are closer than 200
kbp are grouped. In the second phase, the groups that are in synteny are
linked provided that no more than 2 non-syntenic groups are found between
them and they are less than 3Mbp apart.</p>
