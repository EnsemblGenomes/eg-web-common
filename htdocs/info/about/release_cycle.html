<p>[[SPECIESDEFS::SITE_NAME]] is updated regularly with new data, including new genomes, assemblies and 
gene models, and updates and additions to existing data sets. This frequently includes changes 
to cross-genome analysis such as comparative genomics. In addition, each release brings with it 
various improvements and enhancements to the <a href="/info/docs/index.html">Ensembl software platform</a> 
and the customisations made to support the needs of Ensembl Genomes data and users. Each Ensembl 
Genomes release is numbered consecutively using a separate numbering system from Ensembl. 
However, the Ensembl version number is also included in most Ensembl Genomes databases. For 
instance, release 47 of Ensembl Genomes was built using the software and database schemata from 
Ensembl release 100.</p>

<p>There are four Ensembl Genomes releases per year, simultaneous with the release of Ensembl. 
Details of the planned changes for each release are published on our 
<a href="https://www.ensembl.info/category/01-release/">blog</a> approximately two months prior 
to the planned release date, and sent to the <a href="/info/about/contact/mailing.html">Ensembl mailing lists</a>. 
These release intentions describe what is planned for each division. Please note that intentions 
do not always exactly match the final released project as some changes cannot be made or 
additional changes need to be made after intentions are published.</p> 

<p>When a new Ensembl Genomes release is made, an announcement is posted to the 
<a href="/info/about/contact/mailing.html">Ensembl mailing lists</a> and full details made 
available on the <a href="https://www.ensembl.info/category/01-release/">Ensembl blog</a>. This 
includes a general overview and highlights of the release.</p>
