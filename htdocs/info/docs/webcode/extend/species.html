<h1>Changing the species in Ensembl</h1>

<h2>Removing species</h2>

<p>It is obviously simpler to omit species from your Ensembl mirror 
than to add new ones, so we'll look at this first. Simply add the
required <kbd>delete</kbd> lines to the <kbd>update_conf</kbd> method in
<kbd>/public-plugins/mirror/conf/SiteDefs.pm</kbd>:</p>

<pre class="code">
delete($SiteDefs::__species_aliases{'Mus_musculus'});
delete($SiteDefs::__species_aliases{'Rattus_norvegicus'});
</pre>

<p><strong>Important note</strong>: if you are deleting either Human
or Mouse, you need to specify a new primary or secondary species
(these are used as defaults when generating links to examples). E.g.:</p>

<pre class="code">
$SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SECONDARY_SPECIES  = 'Canis_familiaris'; 
</pre>

<h2>Adding species</h2>

<p>To add a species, you obviously need a complete Ensembl database
in the same schema as the rest of your site, which is outside the 
scope of this tutorial. However assuming you have the data already,
the following changes will add it to the website (substituting the
details of your own species for the ones in the examples, obviously!).</p>

<h3>Configuration files</h3>

<p>Firstly, add it to the species aliases in the <kbd>update_conf</kbd> 
method in <kbd>/public-plugins/mirror/conf/SiteDefs.pm</kbd>:</p>

<pre class="code">
$SiteDefs::__species_aliases{'Canis_latrans'}           = [qw(cl coyote)];
$SiteDefs::__species_aliases{'Geococcyx_californianus'} = [qw(gc roadrunner)];
</pre>

<p>Note that all aliases should be unique, so check in 
<kbd>/public-plugins/ensembl/conf/SiteDefs.pm</kbd> to see which 
are already in use. These aliases allow quick access to pages, so that users
can type, e.g. www.ensembl.org/worm/Gene?g=Y42H9B.1 instead of
www.ensembl.org/Caenorhabditis_elegans/Gene?g=Y42H9B.1</p>

<p>You will also need a .ini file for the new species. Copy one of the 
existing files from <kbd>/public-plugins/ensembl/conf/ini-files/</kbd>
to <kbd>/public-plugins/mirror/conf/ini-files/</kbd> and edit it to
reflect the relevant settings. Add sample data points to the species ini file 
to get links into the data - see the [SAMPLE_DATA] section at the bottom of any 
ini file for examples of the correct format</p>

<p>If your species has chromosomes, make sure you have the correct names
in the array ENSEMBL_CHROMOSOMES, as this is used to draw karyotypes.</p>

<p>If your new species lies in a taxonomic group outside the standard Ensembl
eukaryote tree, or if you simply wish to alter the groupings in the dropdown
species list on the home page, see the instructions on 
<a href="specieslist.html">customising the species list on the home page</a>.</p>

<h3>Website database</h3>

<p>Whilst the genomic databases provide the bulk of the data about species
in Ensembl, news and some static content is provided from a separate small
database, <kbd>ensembl_website</kbd>.

<p>Using a MySQL client program, update the ensembl_website database as follows:</p>

<p><kbd>insert into species values (1001, 'cl', 'Canis_latrans', 'Coyote');</kbd></p>

<p>N.B. We suggest using a high primary key value so as to avoid conflict with 
future releases of Ensembl.</p>

<p>Then run the utility script <kbd>/utils/static_content/update_webdb.pl</kbd>, which will
link your new species into the current release.</p>

<h3>Static content</h3>

<p>Species home pages are now dynamically generated, so only a minimum of maintenance
is required. Much of the content is now generated from the databases and ini files.</p>

<p>You can optionally display a piece of static HTML with information about the species -
create a directory <kbd>public-plugins/mirror/htdocs/ssi/species</kbd> and in it a file
about_Canis_latrans.html. This file does not need &lt;html&gt; or  &lt;body&gt; tags, just the
content (including images such as photos or logos) you want to display.</p>

<img src="/img/info/thumb_Canis_latrans.png" style="float:left;width:40px;height:40px;margin-right:10px" />
<p>Finally, you need some kind of species image for the favourites list on the
home page. This should be a 40x40 pixel PNG file named thumb_Canis_latrans.png and
placed in <kbd>/public-plugins/mirror/htdocs/img/species/</kbd>.</p>
