<h1>Customizing and Extending Ensembl</h1>

<p>
The Ensembl webcode is designed to extensible, so that other projects
can customize their own installation without their changes being
overwritten when they update to a new release.
</p>

<p>The Ensembl system of plugins allow a range of customizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>public-plugins/mirror</code> plugin enables you to apply your own server
settings (domain name, admin email address, database names and passwords)
to a standard install of Ensembl</li>
<li>You can further use this plugin to operate a cut-down version of Ensembl
with fewer species</li>
<li>By creating your own plugin, you can completely change the available
species, alter the colour scheme or page template, or add your own views 
and static content.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some tutorials on customizing your site are given below - if you have any 
further questions, please do contact us via the development 
<a href="/info/about/contact/mailing.html">mailing list</a>.</p>

<div class="notice"><strong>Important note</strong>: Regardless of any changes you may
make to your Ensembl website, you <em>must</em> check out all the 
api code, as it is not pluggable. The web code will not work if you only have some of 
the API sections installed..</div>
