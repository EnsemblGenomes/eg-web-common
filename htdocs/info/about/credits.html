Ensembl Genomes is a project run by the EBI.  We benefit, of course, from the extensive work done by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, in collaboration with the EBI, on the development of the Ensembl software system, and continue to work closely with the WTSI to ensure the compatible development of both resources.

The initial releases of Ensembl Genomes was partly funded by the European Commission under FELICS, contract number 021902 (RII3) within the Research Infrastructure Action of the FP6 "Structuring the European Research Area" Programme. The project is currently partly supported by the European Commission under SLING within Research Infrastructures of the FP7 Capacities Specific Programme, grant agreement number 226073 (Integrating Activity). Ensembl Plants is currently in receipt of BBSRC funding to work on genomic variation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.
