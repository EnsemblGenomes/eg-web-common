<h1>Mailing Lists</h1>

<p>Ensembl Genomes has been developed using code originally developed by the
Ensembl project.  Whereas Ensembl concentrates on vertebrate species, Ensembl
Genomes focuses on non-vertebrate species. There are two mailing lists on 
Ensembl, and one specifically for Ensembl Genomes.
</p>

<h2>Ensembl Mailing Lists</h2>

<p>
Ensembl is an open collaborative project.
We are informal and coordinate much of our work by open e-mail lists.
There are two mailing lists on Ensembl:
</p>

<dd>
A low volume mailing list used to announce major updates and major releases. [<a href="http://lists.ensembl.org/ensembl-announce/threads.html">Old archive</a>] [<a href="http://lists.ensembl.org/pipermail/announce/">New archive</a>]
</dd>

<dt id="dev">dev</dt>

<p>
This is a mailing list with all the Ensembl developers and people who are just tracking the project.

Internally we discuss all requests across all team members who are relevant.
